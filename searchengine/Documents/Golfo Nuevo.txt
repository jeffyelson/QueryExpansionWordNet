Golfo Nuevo is a body of water formed by the Península Valdés and Punta Ninfas in the province of Chubut in the Argentine Patagonia.  It is located 650 miles (1,046 km) southwest of Buenos Aires, Argentina.  Puerto Madryn is its major seaport.  From May to December, the southern right whales migrate to Golfo Nuevo to breed.  Golfo Nuevo was also the scene of a series of mysterious submarine contacts in 1958 and 1960.
