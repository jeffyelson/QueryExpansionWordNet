The Gulf of Bothnia (; Finnish: Pohjanlahti; Swedish: Bottniska viken, also divided as Bothnian Bay + Bothnian Sea) is the northernmost arm of the Baltic Sea. It is situated between Finland's west coast (Ostrobothnia) and Sweden's east coast (Westrobothnia and North Bothnia). In the south of the gulf lies Åland, between the Sea of Åland and the Archipelago Sea.
