Cockburn Town ( KOH-b…ôrn) is the capital city of the Turks and Caicos Islands, spreading across most of Grand Turk Island. An attractive town with historic architecture, long narrow streets and old street lamps, it was founded in 1681 by salt collectors. It is home to the Turks & Caicos National Museum which is believed to be over 180 years old. "Her Majesty's Prison", also now a museum, was built in the 1830s, and remained in operation until 1994. Boasting a warm climate all year round, the island is a popular tourist destination, with activities such as snorkeling, reef cruises, bars, and sandy beaches.
