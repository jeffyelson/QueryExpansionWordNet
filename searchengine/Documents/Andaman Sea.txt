The Andaman Sea (historically also known as the Burma Sea) is a marginal sea of the northeastern Indian Ocean bounded by the coastlines of Myanmar and Thailand along the Gulf of Martaban and west side of the Malay Peninsula, and separated from the Bay of Bengal to its west by the Andaman Islands and the Nicobar Islands.  Its southernmost end is defined by Breueh Island, an island just north of Sumatra, and communicates with the Malacca Strait.
Traditionally, the sea has been used for fishery and transportation of goods between the coastal countries and its coral reefs and islands are popular tourist destinations.  The fishery and tourist infrastructure was severely damaged by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami.
