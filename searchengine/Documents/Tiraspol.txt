Tiraspol (Romanian: Tiraspol, Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet: Тираспол; Russian: Тира́споль [tʲɪˈraspəlʲ]; Ukrainian: Тираспіль [tɪˈrɑspilʲ]) is the capital of Transnistria (de facto), a breakaway state in Moldova (de jure), where it is the second largest city. The city is located on the eastern bank of the Dniester River. Tiraspol is a regional hub of light industry, such as furniture and electrical goods production.
The modern city of Tiraspol was founded by the Russian generalissimo Alexander Suvorov in 1792, although the area had been inhabited for thousands of years by varying ethnic groups. The city celebrates its anniversary every year on 14 October.
