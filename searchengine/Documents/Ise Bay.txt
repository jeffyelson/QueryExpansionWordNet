Ise Bay (伊勢湾, Ise-wan) is a bay located at the mouth of the Kiso Three Rivers between Mie and Aichi Prefectures in Japan. Ise Bay has an average depth of 19.5 meters (64 ft) and a maximum depth of 30 meters (98 ft). The mouth of the bay is 9 kilometers (5.6 mi) and is connected to the smaller Mikawa Bay by two channels: the Nakayama Channel and the Morosaki Channel. Mikawa Bay is subsequently joined to the Pacific Ocean by the Irako Channel, which ranges from 50–100 meters (160–330 ft) in depth.
