The American Cordillera is a chain of mountain ranges (cordilleras) that consists of an almost continuous sequence of mountain ranges that form the western "backbone" of North America, South America and  Central America, with Mount Aconcagua as the highest peak. It is also the backbone of the volcanic arc that forms the eastern half of the Pacific Ring of Fire.
