The British Overseas Territories (BOTs), also known as United Kingdom Overseas Territories (UKOTs), are fifteen territories all with a constitutional and historical link with the United Kingdom. They are the last remnants of the former British Empire and do not form part of the United Kingdom itself. Some of the permanently inhabited territories are internally self-governing, with the UK retaining responsibility for defence and foreign relations with foreign and defence not extending to Norfolk Island. Three of the territories are inhabited only by a transitory population of military or scientific personnel.  All but one of the rest are listed by the UN Special Committee on Decolonization as non-self-governing territories. All fifteen  have the British monarch as head of state.As of April 2018, three Territories (the Falkland Islands, Gibraltar and the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia in Cyprus) are the responsibility of the Minister of State for Europe and the Americas; the Minister responsible for the remaining Territories is the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Overseas Territories and Sustainable Development.
