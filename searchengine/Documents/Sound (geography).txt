In geography, a sound is a smaller body of water typically connected to larger sea or ocean.  There is little consistency in the use of "sound" in English-language place names.  It can refer to an inlet, deeper than a bight and wider than a fjord, or a narrow sea or ocean channel between two bodies of land (similar to a strait), or it can refer to the lagoon located between a barrier island and the mainland.
