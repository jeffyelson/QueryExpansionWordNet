The National Congress of Chile (Spanish: Congreso Nacional de Chile) is the legislative branch of the government of the Republic of Chile.
The National Congress of Chile was founded on July 4, 1811. It is a bicameral legislature composed of the Chamber of Deputies (lower house), of 155 Deputies (120 before 2017) and by the Senate (upper house), formed by 43 Senators (38 before 2017) which will increase its size to 50 senators after the next general election.
The organisation of Congress and its powers and duties are defined in articles 42 to 59 of the current constitution and by the Constitutional Organic Law No. 18,918.

Congress meets in the Chile Congress building, which was built during the last years of the Pinochet regime and stands in the port city of Valpara√≠so, some 140 km west of the capital, Santiago. This new building replaced the Former National Congress Building, located in downtown Santiago.
On 13 September 1973, the Government Junta of Chile dissolved Congress.

Statistical analysis suggest Chilean politicians in Congress "are not randomly drawn from the population, but over-represent high-income communities". As such, Chileans of Castilian-Basque, Palestinian and Jewish ancestry are overrepresented in it.
