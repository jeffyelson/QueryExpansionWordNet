The Argentine Sea (Spanish: Mar Argentino) is the name given to the sea within the continental shelf off the Argentine mainland. It lacks international recognition but is symbolically important to Argentina for consolidating the country's national unity behind the concept of Argentine irridentism, an area that extends out to include the British South Atlantic islands and  a section of the Antarctic continent.
