The Sea of Marmara, also known as the Marmara Sea, and in the context of classical antiquity as the Propontis, is an inland sea located entirely within the borders of Turkey. It connects the Black Sea to the Aegean Sea, separating the country's European and Asian part. The Bosphorus strait connects it to the Black Sea and the Dardanelles strait to the Aegean Sea. The former also separates Istanbul's European and Asian side. The Sea of Marmara is a small sea with an area of 11,350 km2 (4,380 sq mi), and dimensions 280 km × 80 km (174 mi × 50 mi). Its greatest depth is 1,370 m (4,490 ft).
