Szczecin Lagoon, also anglicized to Stettin Lagoon (Polish: Zalew Szczeciński, German: Stettiner Haff, since 1945 sometimes also Oderhaff (Oder lagoon) or Pommersches Haff (Pomeranian lagoon)), is a lagoon in the Oder estuary, shared by Germany and Poland. It is separated from the Pomeranian Bay of the Baltic Sea by the islands of Usedom and Wolin. The lagoon is subdivided into the Kleines Haff (Polish: Mały Zalew, "small lagoon") in the West and the Wielki Zalew (German: Großes Haff, "great lagoon") in the East. An ambiguous historical German name was Frisches Haff, which later exclusively referred to the Vistula Lagoon.
