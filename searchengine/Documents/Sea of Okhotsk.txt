The Sea of Okhotsk (Russian: Охо́тское мо́ре, tr. Okhótskoye móre pronounced [ɐˈxot͡skəjə ˈmorʲe]; Japanese: オホーツク海, romanized: Ohōtsuku-kai) is a marginal sea of the western Pacific Ocean. It is located between Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula on the east, the Kuril Islands on the southeast, Japan's island of Hokkaido on the south, the island of Sakhalin along the west, and a stretch of eastern Siberian coast along the west and north. The northeast corner is the Shelikhov Gulf. The sea is named after Okhotsk, the first Russian settlement in the Far East.
