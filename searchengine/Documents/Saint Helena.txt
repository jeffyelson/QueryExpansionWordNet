It is one of three constituent parts of the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha.It measures about 16 by 8 kilometres (10 by 5 mi) and has a population of 4,439 per the 2021 census. It was named after Saint Helena of Constantinople. It is one of the remotest islands in the world and was uninhabited when discovered by the Portuguese in 1502. For centuries it was an important stopover for ships sailing to Europe from Asia and Southern Africa. Saint Helena is the United Kingdom's second-oldest overseas territory after Bermuda. It is perhaps best known for being the site Napoleon was exiled to after his final defeat in 1815.
