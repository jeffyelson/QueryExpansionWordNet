The Constitution of Monaco, first adopted in 1911 after the Mon√©gasque Revolution and heavily revised by Prince Rainier III on 17 December 1962, outlines three branches of government, including several administrative offices and a number of councils, who share advisory and legislative power with the prince.
The constitution also defines the line of succession to the Monegasque throne; this section was modified on 2 April 2002.
By word count, it is the shortest constitution in the world currently in force.
