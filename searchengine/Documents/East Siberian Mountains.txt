The East Siberian Mountains or East Siberian Highlands (Russian: Восточно-Сибирское нагорье) are one of the largest mountain systems of the Russian Federation. They are located between the Central Yakutian Lowland and the Bering Strait in the Far Eastern Federal District and Northeast Siberia. The whole area of the East Siberian System has a very low population density. The territory of the mountain system is one of the Great Russian Regions.
In some areas of the East Siberian Mountains, such as the Kisilyakh Range and the Oymyakon Plateau there are kigilyakhs, the rock formations that are highly valued in the culture of the Yakuts.
