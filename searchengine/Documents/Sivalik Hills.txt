The Sivalik Hills (also known as the Shivalik Hills and Churia Hills) are a mountain range of the outer Himalayas that stretches from the Indus River about 2,400 km (1,500 mi) eastwards close to the Brahmaputra River, spanning across the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent. It is 10–50 km (6.2–31.1 mi) wide with an average elevation of 1,500–2,000 m (4,900–6,600 ft). Between the Teesta and Raidāk Rivers in Assam is a gap of about 90 km (56 mi). Sivalik literally means 'tresses of Shiva’. Sivalik region is home to the Soanian archaeological culture.
