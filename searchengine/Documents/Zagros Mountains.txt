The Zagros Mountains (Persian: کوه‌های زاگرس, Kuh hā-ye Zāgros; Luri: کویل زاگروس‎, Koyal Zagros; Turkish: Zagros Dağları; Kurdish: چیاکانی زاگرۆس, romanized: Çiyakani Zagros) are a long mountain range in Iran, northern Iraq and southeastern Turkey. This mountain range has a total length of 1,600 km (990 mi). The Zagros mountain range begins in northwestern Iran and roughly follows Iran's western border, while covering much of southeastern Turkey and northeastern Iraq. From this border region, the range continues to the southeast under also the waters of the Persian Gulf. It spans the whole length of the western and southwestern Iranian plateau, ending at the Strait of Hormuz. The highest point is Mount Dena, at 4,409 metres (14,465 ft).
