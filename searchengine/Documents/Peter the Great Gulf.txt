The gulf extends for 185 km (115 mi) from the Russian-North Korean border at the mouth of the Tumen River in the west across to Cape Povorotny in the east, and its bays reach 90 km (56 mi) inland.
Vladivostok, the largest city and capital of Primorsky Krai, and Nakhodka, the third largest city in the Krai, are located along the coast of the gulf.
