Saros Bay or Gulf of Saros (Turkish: Saros Körfezi; originally Greek: κόλπος του Σάρρου). Ancient Greeks also called it Gulf of Melas (Μέλανα κόλπον), before it was renamed.The bay is 75 km (47 mi) long and 35 km (22 mi) wide. Far from industrialized areas and thanks to underwater currents, it is a popular summer recreation resort with sandy strands and crystal-clear sea. Scuba diving, windsurfing and fishing are the most practiced water sports here.
Settlements around the bay are: Gökçetepe, Mecidiye, Erikli, Danişment, Yayla, Karaincirli, Vakıf, Büyükevren, Sultaniçe, Gülçavuş and Enez, all in Edirne Province. The islands of Gökçeada (Imbros) lie outside Saros Bay and Samothrace in the Aegean Sea, Greece, is in short distance.
The North Anatolian Fault Zone, the most prominent active fault in Turkey and the source of numerous large earthquakes throughout the history, passes through the Gulf of İzmit and traverses the Marmara Sea reaching to the Saros Bay to the southeast.On the Southern shore of the Dardanelles, across from Gallipoli, was the location of legendary Troy.
