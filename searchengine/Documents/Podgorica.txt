Podgorica (Cyrillic: Подгорица, pronounced [pǒdɡoritsa]; lit. "area below the little hill") is the capital and largest city of Montenegro.
The city was known as Titograd (Cyrillic: Титоград, pronounced [tîtoɡraːd]) between 1946 and 1992—in the period that Montenegro formed, as the Socialist Republic of Montenegro, part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY)—in honour of Marshal Josip Broz Tito.
Podgorica's favourable position at the confluence of the Ribnica and Morača rivers and at the meeting-point of the fertile Zeta Plain and Bjelopavlići Valley has encouraged settlement. The city is close to winter skiing centers in the north and to seaside resorts on the Adriatic Sea. Podgorica is home to approximately 30% of the country's population. It is also the nation's administrative center and its economic, cultural, and educational focus.
