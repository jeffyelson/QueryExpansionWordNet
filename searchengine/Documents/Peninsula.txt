A peninsula (Latin: paeninsula from paene 'almost' and insula 'island') is a landform surrounded by water on most of its border while being connected to a mainland from which it extends. The surrounding water is usually understood to be continuous, though not necessarily named as a  body of water. A river which courses through a very tight meander is also sometimes said to form a "peninsula" within the (almost closed) loop of water. A peninsula is land with bodies of water on three sides of it.There is no precise definition distinguishing peninsulas from less prominent extensions, and extensions conventionally considered peninsulas are not always named as such; they can also be referred to as a headland, cape, island promontory, bill, point, fork, or spit. A point is generally considered a  piece of land projecting into a body of water that is less prominent than a cape. The area of peninsulas can range from tiny to very large.
