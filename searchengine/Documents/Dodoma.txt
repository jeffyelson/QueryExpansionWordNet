Dodoma (lit.â€‰'It has sunk' in Gogo), officially Dodoma City, is the national capital of Tanzania and the capital of the Dodoma Region, with a population of 410,956. It was founded in 1907 by German colonists during construction of the Tanzanian central railway. The layout followed the typical colonial planning of the time with a European quarter segregated from a native village. 
In 1974, the Tanzanian government announced that the capital would be moved to Dodoma for social and economic reasons and to centralise the capital within the country. It became the official capital in 1996.  Much of the initial design never came to fruition however, and government offices and embassies have resisted moving offices to Dodoma. As a result, Dar es Salaam remains the commercial and de facto capital of Tanzania.
